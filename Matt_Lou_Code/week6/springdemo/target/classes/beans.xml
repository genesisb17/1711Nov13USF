The above is a spring bean configuration file
It is an XML file that acts as a cement that 
glues the beans, i.e. the classes together. This file needs
to be created under the src directory usually developers name this file as
Beans.xml, but you can choose any name you like. You have to make sure that
this file is available in CLASSPATH and use the same name in the main application 
while creating an application context as shown in MainApp.java file. The Beans.xml
is used to assign unique IDs to different beans and to control the creation of objects
