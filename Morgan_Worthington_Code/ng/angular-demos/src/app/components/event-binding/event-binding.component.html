<p>
  event binding is denoted by ()
  surrounding any browser regonized event with () will
  create an event listener for that event
</p>
<p>
  in this example we listen for the click event to
  call the increment function defined on the component class
</p>
<p>
  {{ counter }}
</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="incrementCounter()">increment</button>
