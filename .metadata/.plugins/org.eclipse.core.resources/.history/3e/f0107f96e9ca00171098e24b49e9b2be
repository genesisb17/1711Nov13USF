 * DOM XML Parser in Java:

 * XML in a tree format, where every element represent a trre
 * branch. A Dom parser creates an in-memory trre representation of the xml
 * file,then parses it. So it requires more memory.
 * Dom parsing is fast for a small xml file but is slow or 
 * may not even load larger xml files because it requies a 
 * lot of memory to create an Xml Dom tree.
