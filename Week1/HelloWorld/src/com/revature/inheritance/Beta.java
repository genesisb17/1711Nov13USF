 * instance methods are overridden and variables are hidden.
 *  which method is 
 * invoked depends on the class of the actual object, while which field is accessed depends on the class
 * of the variable
 * Here, b refers to an object of class Beta, so b.getH() will call the overridden (subclass's) method. However, the ref type
 * of b is Baap so b.h will refer to Baap's h. Further, inside 
 * Beta's getH(), Beta's h will be accessed inside of Baap's h because
 * you are accessing this.h ('this' is implicit) and the type of this is Beta
 * The class of bb, on the other hand, is Beta, so bb.h will refer to Betas h
