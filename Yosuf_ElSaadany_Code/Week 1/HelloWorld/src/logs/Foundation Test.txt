java.util.function.Predicate is one of the several functional interfaces 
that have been added to Java 8. This interface has exactly one abstract
method named test, which takes any object as input and returns a boolean. This comes in very handy when you have a collection of objects and you want to go through each object of that collection and see if that object satisfies some criteria. For example, you may have a collection of Employee objects and, in one place of your application, you want to remove all such employees whose age is below 50, while in other place, you want to remove all such employees whose salary is above 100,000. In both the cases, you want to go through your collection of employees, and check each Employee object to determine if it fits the criteria. This can be implemented by writing an interface named CheckEmployee and having a method check(Employee ) which would return true if the passed object satisfies the criteria. The following code fragments illustrate how it can be done -
