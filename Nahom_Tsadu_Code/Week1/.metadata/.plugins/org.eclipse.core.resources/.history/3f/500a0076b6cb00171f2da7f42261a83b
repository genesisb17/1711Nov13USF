1CORE JAVAHOM EWORK
Essential Interview QuestionsIn Eclipse, create one Java project for the homework with a separate 
package for each question, and use comments liberally in your code:

Q1. Perform a bubble sort on the following integer array:  1,0,5,6,3,2,3,7,9,8,4

Q2. Write a program to display the first 25 Fibonacci numbersbeginning at 0.

Q3.Reverse a string without using a temporary variable.  
	Do NOTuse reverse() in the StringBuffer or the StringBuilder APIs.
	
Q4.Write a program to compute N factorial.

Q5.Write a substring method that accepts a string str and an integer idx and 
	returns the substring  contained  between  0  and  idx-1inclusive.
	Do  NOT  use  any  of  the  existing substring methods in the String, StringBuilder, 
	or StringBuffer APIs.
	
Q6.Write  a program  to  determine  if  an  integeris  even  without  using  the  modulus 
	operator (%)

Q7.Sort twoemployeesbased on their name, department,and age using the Comparator interface.

Q8.Write  a  program  that  stores  the  following  strings  in  an  ArrayList  and  saves  
	all  the palindromes in another ArrayList.
	
	“karan”, “madam”,”tom”, “civic”, “radar”, “sexes”, “jimmy”, “kayak”, “john”,  “refer”, 
	“billy”, “did”
	
Q9.Create an ArrayList which stores numbers from 1 to 100 and printsout all the prime numbers 
	to the console.
	
==================================================================

Q10.Find the minimum of two numbers using ternaryoperators.

Q11.Write  a  program  that  would  access  two  float-variables from a  class  that  exists  
	in another  package. Note,  you will need  to  create two  packages  to  demonstrate  
	the solution.

Q12.Write a program to store numbers from 1 to 100 in an array. Print out all the even numbers 
	from the array. Use the enhanced FORloop for printing out the numbers.
	
Q13.Display the triangleon the console as follows using any type of loop.  Do NOTuse a simple 
	groupof print statementsto accomplish this.
	
	01 01 0 10 1 0 1
	
Q14.Write  a  program  that  demonstrates  the  switch  case.  Implement  the  following 
	functionalities in the cases:
	
	Case1: Find the square root of a number using the Math class method. 
	
	Case2: Display today’s date.
	
	Case3: Split the following string and store it in a sting array: "I am learning Core Java”
		
Q15.Write a program that defines an interface havingthe following methods:addition, subtraction,  
	multiplication,  and  division.   Create  class  that  implements this  interfaceand  provides  
	appropriate  functionality  to  carry  out  the  required  operations.  Hard  code two operands 
	in a test class having a main method that calls the implementing class.

Q16.Write a program to display the number of characters for a stringinput. The stringshould be entered 
	as a command line argument using(String [] args).

Q17.Write a program that calculates the simple interest on the principal, rate of interest and  number  
	of  years  provided  by  the  user.  Enter  principal,  rate  and  time  through  the console using 
	the Scanner class.Interest = Principal* Rate* Time

Q18.Write  a  program having  a  concrete subclass  that inherits three  abstract methods from  asuperclass.    
Provide  the  following  three  implementations  in  the  subclass corresponding to the abstract methods 
in the superclass:
	1.Check for uppercasecharacters in a string, and return‘true’or ‘false’ depending if any are found.
	2.Convert  all of  the lower  case characters  to uppercasein  the  input  string,  and return the result.
    3.Convert the input string to integer and add10, output the result to the console.Create an appropriate 
    	class having a main method to test the above setup.
    
Q19.Create an ArrayList and insert integers 1 through 10. Display the ArrayList. Add all the even numbers 
	up and display the result. Add all the odd numbers up and display the result.  Remove  the  prime  
	numbers  from  the  ArrayList  and  print  out  the  remaining ArrayList.
	
Q20.Create a notepad file called Data.txtand enter the following: 
	Mickey:Mouse:35:Arizona
	Hulk:Hogan:50:Virginia
	Roger:Rabbit:22:California
	Wonder:Woman:18:Montana
	
	Write a program that would read from the file and print it out to the screen in the following format:
	Name: Mickey MouseAge: 35 yearsState: Arizona State
