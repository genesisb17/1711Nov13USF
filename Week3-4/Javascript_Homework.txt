%%%
%%%
%%%
Example for printShape("Triangle", 3, "$");
$
$$

Please put the question itself as a comment above each answer.

NOTE: Part II will be done twice: once with Javascript and once with jQuery.
	  They should be done separately.
	  Copy the index.html file and rename them to: indexJavascript.html and indexJQuery.html
