FLOW

Start app in login form.. mine is at home.html 
form has the action tag of login w method post, 
taking us to a servlet with the url-mapping of
/login and its doPost method 

said doPost method uses the service class to validate
user information w our database, and upon successful
login, will forward us to our app.html page
in addition, this servlet is where we add our 
validated user to our HttpSession, for careful 
tracking throughout our project

NEXT 
in the app.html, 
we include the script of demo.js, which tells the browser
that upon loading of the window, we want to run the function 
loadDashboardView();

this function essentially loads our landing page for 
the user, where we want to have their basic user info
That being said, the loaddashboard function calls a 
get user info function
both of these are functions w AJAX requests that 
send get/post requests to our servlets
