	       		<p>Structured and object oriented programming are different in how functions are implemented. Structured 
	       		programming applied their functions in a global scope, while OOP applies functions to their object.
	       		Structured is associated with lower-level programming and has a linear sequence to its execution.
	       		Object oriented programming is more versatile in its non-linear nature, making this language excellent
	       		for application programming. </p>

    <div class="col-md-3" style="background-color:lavender;"><h4>Abstraction</h4>
    	<p>Abstraction is important to OOP in order to reduce complexity of code
    	and also to improve readability. When thinking of abstraction, one could imagine a television. 
    	The underlying electrical working isn't important, we just want to be able to know its resolution 
    	and other useful features without knowing how the underlying electrical work to presents the image.</p> 
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-3" style="background-color:lavenderblush;"><h4>Encapsulation</h4>
    	<p>Somewhat related to abstraction, encapsulation also deals with information hiding
    	but in a sense where we want to protect our hidden code. We want to restrict access 
    	to certain modules from other parts of our code in order to prevent an sort of unwanted
    	changes. This isn't the act of hiding the information itself but leads to this idea. This
    	is achieved by how we declare our access modifiers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-3" style="background-color:lavender;"><h4>Polymorphism</h4>
    	<p>The literal definition of polymorphism is the ability to take many shapes. This is a useful
    	way to remember how polymorphism works in OOP, only the difference is we can implement a method
    	differently through either changing the parameters or the implementation itself. So a child class
    	can have a different implementation of a function that the parent class passes down. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3" style="background-color:lavenderblush;"><h4>Inheritance</h4>
    	<p>Inheritance takes on a more literal identity of its denotation. Similarly how one would inherit 
    	possessions from a passed-on relative, a class will inherit the members of it's parent class, without
    	the passing-on part. In short, one could think of inheritance as the ability to create a new class 
    	from an existing class.</p>
