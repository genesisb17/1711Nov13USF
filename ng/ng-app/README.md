# angulator
Angulator is meant to be used to teach associates basics, foundations and advanced topics of Angular needed in our curriculum at Revature.

The idea of this project is to collaborate on it as a team and at somepoint make it centralized and available as content that we can all use in the training team to teach Angular.

You can choose wathever approach you are more confortable with, however, what I do is that I give them the app without routing implemented. That way I can teach them how to create a module from the ground up (the routing module). With that, they can start connecting the dots to make components linked on the navbar to actually start working, and you can take that opportunity to go over the topic like if it was a slide, and of course, this app becomes their notes! As a side note, remember that all components are pointing to the actual documentation of Angular that contains information about the topic.

After finishing all sections in the navbar, the Demo section is the one that I complete from the ground up with them so they can get more exposure on how to start components from scracth and start using all the learned topics and introduce more advanced topics as well.

Feel free to add more sections to the app or modify some of the existing ones.
